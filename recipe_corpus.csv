0,,"                     Start by submerging the chicken in brine - you can make the brine by making a 95% water and 5% salt solution. Leave the chicken in brine for at least 3 hours                                       Remove the chicken from the brine, season with freshly ground black pepper and rub with olive oil                                       Place on the barbecue for 2 1/2 minutes. Turn over and colour the other side for 2 1/2 minutes                                       Move the chicken up to a higher shelf and close the lid of the barbecue. Reduce the temperature of the barbecue and cook for a further 20 minutes - this will only work if you have an electric barbecue, if not, transfer to the grill and cook on a low heat for a similar amount of time. To check that its cooked, stick a thermometer in the chicken thigh - 63-65°C will indicate that the chicken is done                                       Toss all the ingredients together in a bowl and add salt, pepper, olive oil and lemon juice. Leave to souse for 3 or 4 minutes.                                       To serve, remove the chicken from the barbecue or grill, slice and serve with the coleslaw                 ",easy,0
1,,"                     For the turkey arancini, add the cooked risotto to a large bowl and break up with a spatula                                       Add the leftover turkey, thyme, sage, mozzarella and pepper, stirring to combine                                       Pour some water into a separate bowl and moisten your hands slightly. Roll the risotto mix into 12 balls, wetting your hands frequently to stop the mix from sticking                                        Place on a tray, cover with cling film and store in the fridge to set for 30-60 minutes                                       For the parsnip purée, add the parsnip and milk to a saucepan and bring to a gentle simmer. Leave on the heat for 15-20 minutes, or until the parsnip is cooked through                                       Pass the contents of the pan through a fine sieve, reserving the milk. Add the parsnip to a blender and blitz with enough of the reserved milk to form a thick purée                                       Combine the purée with the yoghurt in a bowl. Season with a pinch of salt and set aside                                       Once set, remove the arancini balls from the fridge and heat the oil in a deep-fat fryer to 175°C                                       Prepare 3 bowls, add flour to the first, the beaten eggs to the second and pour breadcrumbs into the third                                       Dip the arancini in flour, tapping to remove any excess before coating in the egg wash and finally the breadcrumbs                                       Gently lower the crumbed arancini into the hot oil, 3-4 at a time. Fry for 3-4 minutes until crunchy and golden                                       Remove from the oil and drain on kitchen towel. Serve warm with the yoghurt and parsnip dip and the green salad                 ",easy,0
2,,"                     To debone the chicken thighs, place each thigh, skin-side down, onto a board and use a sharp knife to cut along either side of the bones. Slide the knife underneath the bone and run it down the underside to release the entire piece                                       In a suitable container, salt the thighs for 2 hours. Wash and dry the meat before storing, skin-side up, in a vac pac bag (or wrapped in cling film) overnight                                       To prepare the morels, wash 3 times in cold water, changing the water every time to ensure they are well cleaned                                       Place on a tray lined with kitchen towel and leave to dry in the fridge for 2 hours, before covering in cling film                                       For the wild garlic velouté, bring the milk and cream to the boil, add wild garlic and salt and return to the boil                                       Remove from the heat and allow to cool slightly. While still warm, pass through a fine strainer into a bowl set over ice. Set aside until ready to serve                                        For the chicken thighs, add a small amount of rapeseed oil to a large frying pan and place over a medium-high heat. Add the thighs to the pan, skin-side down, and cook for 4 minutes until golden brown                                       Reduce to a low heat and turn the thighs over. Add the butter, thyme and garlic and cook for an additional 1 minute. Use a spoon to baste the chicken continuously for 2 more minutes, then remove from the heat and keep warm                                       Trim the woody ends off the base of the asparagus and peel halfway up the spear, leaving the top un-peeled. Blanch in salted boiling water for 2 minutes. Remove from the pan and keep on a tray lined with kitchen towel in a warm place                                       Place the thigh, skin-side up, under a hot grill to crisp up the skin. Portion and square off the edges of the thigh. Arrange the thighs onto plates with the morels, velouté, asparagus and wild garlic flowers. Serve immediately                 ",medium,1
3,,"                 To make the most tender flaky pastry, you will need to pulse the flour, salt and butter together in a food processor until you have a uniform crumb with no lumps of butter within the flour. Add the soured cream and pulse again until the dough starts to form a ball                                Tip on to a work surface and gently bring together with your hands. Cut off roughly one-third of the pastry and shape into a disc. Shape the remaining two-thirds into another disc. Wrap both discs individually in clingfilm and chill in the refrigerator for about an hour until firm                                Next, cook all the ingredients for the filling. Melt 25–30g of the butter in a large frying pan and fry the onions and carrots with a generous seasoning of salt over a low heat for 10–15 minutes until they begin to caramelise, stirring occasionally. Remove from the pan and set aside                                Melt the remaining butter in the same pan and fry the chicken thighs over a medium heat for 6–8 minutes on each side, seasoning with salt and pepper as you turn. If using thighs with skin, make sure to get it nice and crispy. Let them cool slightly before pulling the chicken apart with your fingers – you want juicy bite-sized chunks or strips                                Cook the rice in plenty of salted boiling water for a minute or so less than the packet instructions – you want it to be al dente, as it will cook further once inside the pie. Drain and let it cool. Roughly chop the hard-boiled eggs and mix them with all the herbs. Season generously with salt and pepper                                Line a large (3-litre) bowl with clingfilm, making sure there is a bit of overhang around the sides. Remove the bigger disc of pastry from the refrigerator and lightly flour the work surface. Roll out the disc into a rough circle until it’s about 3mm thick and use it to carefully line your clingfilm-covered bowl, ensuring there are no air pockets between the bowl and the pastry. Return to the refrigerator while you roll out the smaller disc in a circle to the same thickness                                When the filling ingredients are sufficiently cool, remove the pastry-lined bowl from the refrigerator and start layering, beginning with the herby eggs, followed by the onions and carrots, chicken and finally the rice. Make sure you firmly pack down each layer before adding the next, as this helps the pie to hold its shape once you flip it and remove the bowl                                Brush the pastry rim with some of the beaten egg (reserve the rest for later) and top the pie with the smaller pastry disc. Pinch together to seal, leaving the overhang. Chill the pie in the refrigerator for a couple of hours                                When you’re ready to bake the pie, preheat the oven to 180°C fan/gas mark 6. Place a baking tray lined with baking parchment on top of the bowl. Holding the base of the bowl, quickly flip it and the baking tray over together, then carefully remove the bowl and clingfilm to reveal your pie                                Trim and crimp or twist the edges, then brush the whole pie with the remaining beaten egg. If you have any dough left over, you can also add some ornate shapes to decorate the pie and give it a folksy Russian look. Use a knife to cut a cross in the top to allow the steam to escape. Bake for 1 hour 20 minutes or until golden brown and a metal skewer inserted into the steam hole comes out hot                                Bring the whole pie to the table and add an element of performance by pouring the hot chicken broth into the hole at the top. Alternatively, enjoy a slice of the pie with a steaming mug of broth on the side              ",medium,1
4,,"                     To make the brine, pour all of the ingredients into a pan and simmer until the salt and sugar dissolves. Leave to cool, then add the quails to the brine. Set aside for 2 hours and 30 minutes                                       Meanwhile, make the sauce. Pour a drizzle of olive oil into a saucepan and start to caramelise the chicken wings and quail bones. Once golden, add the sherry vinegar then drain the bones into a colander. Pour a little more olive oil into the pan, add the shallots and mushrooms and sweat for 5 minutes. Return the bones to the pan, pour in the chicken and veal stock and add the thyme. Bring to the boil and simmer for 1 hour                                       To make the gastrique, add all the ingredients to a saucepan and simmer until reduced by half                                       Pass the quail sauce through a sieve into a clean pan. Add some of the gastrique then reduce on a high heat, constantly checking the flavor and consistency. Once you have the desired flavour, keep warm                                       Remove the quails from the brine, clean with fresh cold water and pat dry. Keep in the fridge until needed                                       Now make the farce. Pour the brandy over the foie gras and place in the freezer                                       Sweat the bacon in olive oil until golden, then drain in a colander. Sweat the lardo in a dry pan for 2 minutes, then drain in the colander with the bacon. Sweat the shallots in olive oil for 15 minutes, or until soft and translucent then also drain in the colander. Pan-fry the chicken livers for 2 minutes in olive oil, then remove from the heat. Chop the livers and add to the other ingredients in the colander                                       Add a dash of olive oil to the pan and add the spinach. Cook until wilted, then drain and squeeze out any excess liquid. Roughly chop the spinach and set aside                                       Place the drained bacon, lardo, shallots and chicken livers in a large bowl, then add the thyme, hazelnuts, breadcrumbs and cooked spinach. Add the soaked sultanas, along with any unabsorbed Sauternes                                       Remove the frozen foie gras from the freezer and gently combine with the ingredients in the bowl. Season to taste, then weigh the mixture into 60g egg-shaped balls. Place the portions in the freezer until frozen solid                                       Once the farce is frozen, insert into the cavity of one of the quails and using 2 cocktail sticks, fasten both ends of skin. Repeat with all the quails. Cling film each quail then steam for 10 minutes                                       Cook the green beans for the salad in salted boiling water until just tender. Drain and set aside                                       To make the truffle vinaigrette, combine the ingredients in a bowl. Gently reheat the quail jus in a pan                                       Preheat the oven to 210°C/fan 190°C/gas mark 7                                       To serve, brown the quails all over in a frying pan with olive oil then roast in the oven for 3 minutes                                        Remove from the oven and rest for 5 minutes. Slice the bird in half and place on a plate, removing the cocktail sticks. Dress the green beans, chicory, hazelnut and shallot in the truffle vinaigrette and place next to the quail. Finally, spoon the sauce over the quail and serve                 ",challenging,2
5,,"                     For the sage and onion stuffing, place a large frying pan over a medium heat. Add a small drizzle of rapeseed oil and knob of butter to the pan and gently fry the onion and garlic until soft                                       Continue to cook until golden brown, then deglaze with the sherry vinegar and reduce until almost dry. Add the honey and fresh chopped sage, season to taste. Remove from the heat and allow to cool                                        For the suet dough, place the flour, suet, salt and pepper into a large bowl and gradually add the water and mix into a dough until it comes together. Place in the fridge to rest for 10 minutes                                        Roll out the dough on a lightly floured surface to a thickness of 2mm. Line 4 greased (180ml capacity) dariole moulds. Line each mould with the pastry, leaving enough dough to allow for the filling                                         Once the filling is cool enough, pack the lined moulds with the sage and onion mix, seal the pudding with a rolled out piece of suet pastry                                       Use 4 square pieces of foil to encase the pudding in the moulds. Steam for 35 minutes. Remove the puddings from the steamer and allow to stand for 10 minutes before turning out and serving                                        For the Madeira gravy, heat a little rapeseed oil in a small saucepan over a medium heat.

7,,"                     To begin, slightly soften the butter for the devilled butter. Blitz in a blender with the remaining ingredients until well-blended but coarse in texture                                       Transfer to a sheet of cling film and roll into a tight cylinder. Refrigerate until set solid                                       Preheat the oven to 180°C/gas mark 4                                       To make the oxtail for the macaroni cheese, brown the oxtail in a hot ovenproof saucepan with a dash of oil until nicely coloured all over. Remove and set aside. Add the vegetables to the pan and brown well                                       Add the beer, thyme and star anise and reduce until sticky. Add the oxtail pieces back to the pan along with the chicken stock. Cover and cook in the oven for 2.5 hours, then allow to cool in the pan (you can do this the day before)                                       Once the oxtail has cooled, pick the meat from the bone and keep in a bowl. Reduce the cooking liquor by half until rich, then set aside                                       Remove the T-bone from the fridge an hour before cooking                                       Preheat the oven to 180°C/gas mark 4                                       To make the macaroni cheese, melt the butter and flour to a heavy-based pan. Cook out for 5 minutes, then slowly add the milk.

10,,"                     To begin, make the fermented lettuce as this will need to be started way ahead of serving. Place the lettuce in a vacuum bag with a pinch of sea salt, seal, and leave at room temperature for around 3 weeks depending on the weather (warmer weather requires a shorter time, colder weather will need a longer time to ferment). After 3 weeks, the bag should have inflated. Check the lettuce with a digital pH tester or litmus paper – it needs to reach a pH of 3 to ensure it has fermented properly. Once fermented, remove the lettuce (retaining the liquid that has been released in the bag and cut into quarters. Cut each quarter into slices, place in an airtight container with the ferment liquid and seal. This will keep in the fridge for a number of weeks                                       For the burger, combine the raw shallot, garlic and minced wagyu beef in the bowl of a stand mixer and mix with a paddle attachment until combined (you can also do this by hand with a little elbow grease). Cook off a piece of the mixture to check for seasoning and adjust accordingly with sea salt. Once seasoned, set the mixture in a container so the mixture is about 4cm deep. Place in the fridge to chill and set                                       For the mayonnaise, add the egg yolks, vinegar and mustard to a blender and blitz to combine. With the motor running slowly, gradually add the oil in a slow, steady stream to creation an emulsion. Add salt to taste                                       Break the bread into pieces and add to the blender. Blitz on a high speed until you have a smooth purée. Check the seasoning and, if needed, season with a little rice wine vinegar and white pepper. Store in a piping bag until ready to serve                                       To prepare the pickles, combine the sugar and vinegar in a container, stirring to dissolve the sugar. Add the cucumber and shallots and set aside for 1 hour before serving                                       Remove the burger mixture from the container and cut into 5 x 5cm squares. Return to the fridge until ready to cook                                       Toast the sesame seeds in a hot, dry pan until golden.

Wrap in cling film and leave to rest for 1 hour                               Meanwhile, make the ragù. Sauté the onions and garlic with the fennel seeds and bay leaf in a splash of oil until soft but not coloured                               Add the sausage meat, stir until nicely browned, then add the white wine and reduce by three quarters                               Add the tin of tomatoes and season with salt and pepper. Cook down for around 20 minutes until the sauce has thickened. Keep warm                               When ready to shape the malloreddus, cut off a piece off the dough and roll into a thin cylinder, around 0.7cm in diameter.

Cook gently for about 10 minutes until softened. Add the thyme and continue to cook for a few more minutes. Tip into a shallow bowl and set aside to cool                                In a large mixing bowl mix together the eggs, Dijon mustard, tomato ketchup, Worcestershire sauce, Tabasco and spices. Finely chop the sun-dried tomatoes (you’ll need some oil from the jar later) and add to the bowl. Season with salt and pepper. Add the beef and pork mince and breadcrumbs and then the cooled vegetables. Use your hands to squidge it all together                               Lightly oil a 1kg loaf tin with some of the sun-dried tomato oil and then use the bacon to line the base and sides of the tin. Fill the loaf tin almost to the top with your magic meaty mixture, pressing down well, and flip any overhanging bacon back over the top. Cover the top of the tin with a piece of baking paper and secure with string                               Place the loaf tin in a deep roasting tray and half-fill the tray with boiling water. Carefully transfer to the oven and cook for 1 1/4 hours                               Remove the loaf tin from the tray and set the tray of hot water aside for now. Carefully remove the baking paper and drain away any liquid that is in the loaf tin. Preheat the grill to high. Turn your loaf out on to a lightly oiled baking tray and place under the grill for 8–10 minutes, or until the bacon is nicely browned                               Meanwhile take your Savoy cabbage leaves and cut away the tough central stalk.

13,,"                     For the honey mustard glazed ham, soak the gammon in a large bucket or pan of cold water overnight - this will help to reduce the salt content. The next day, remove the gammon and discard the soaking water                                       Place the gammon in a large pan, cover with fresh water and bring to the boil. Once the water is boiling, drain the liquid and refill the pan with cold water                                       Add the onions, whole peeled carrot, celery stick, halved garlic bulb, peppercorns and the bay leaves to the water. Bring to a slow simmer and leave simmering for 2.5 hours                                       During this time, top up with boiling water if needed. Skim away any scum that rises to the surface during the cooking process                                       Probe the meat at regular intervals - at the end of cooking it should reach a minimum internal temperature of 63°C, but should not exceed 70°C or it will dry out. Leave to cool for an hour in the liquid                                       Reserve 2 pints of the cooking liquid for the parsley sauce and pour the remainder of it away (or use for pea soup). Place the ham in a roasting tray and remove the skin, ensuring you keep a thin layer of fat, and score a criss-cross pattern into the fat. Stud a clove into each cross. Set the oven to 180°C/gas mark 4                                       To prepare the glaze, combine the oil, honey, mustard and sherry vinegar in a mixing bowl. With a spoon, smear some of the glaze over the ham and bake in the oven for 10 minutes                                       After 10 minutes, baste with more of the remaining glaze and juices that have dripped off the ham. Repeat the process again every 10 minutes for the next 30 minutes to build up a thick, sticky glaze                                       Wash, peel and remove any black spots from the potatoes. Cut into even sizes, ensuring there are plenty of straight edges and right angles - this is easier to achieve with large potatoes                                       Place the potatoes in a large pan and cover with cold water. Season heavily with salt - the water should taste like the sea. Bring the potatoes to a slow boil, cook until they are nearly cooked, then drain from the water                                       Once drained, place the potatoes back in the pan, put the lid on and then shake firmly so that they start to break up on the outside, but not all the way through                                       Place a heavy-based roasting tray over 2 hob rings, add the duck fat and allow to melt. Add the potatoes to the tray and turn over with a fish slice - you are looking to achieve a golden, crisp colour on the potatoes. The colour does not need to be even all over                                       Meanwhile, check the ham to see if it is golden all over. Once golden, rest for 10 minutes in a warm place                                       Increase the oven to 220°C/gas mark 7                                       Once the potatoes have a good amount of colour, and before they start to burn, place them in the oven and roast until golden all over. Once ready to serve, sprinkle with chopped sage and marjoram                                       For the bread sauce, peel a small onion and stud with the cloves. Place the garlic, onion and bay leaves into a medium sized pan with the milk and bring slowly to the boil to infuse                                       In a medium sized pan, melt the butter then coat the celeriac in the butter. Strain the infused milk on to the celeriac and simmer for 15-20 minutes until tender. Do not worry if the milk splits                                       Season with salt and white pepper. Once the celeriac is tender, blitz in a blender and keep warm until ready to serve                                       For the broccoli, bring a large pan of heavily salted water to the boil. Cook the broccoli for 3-4 minutes until the stems are just tender                                       Drain the broccoli and immediately place into cold water to halt the cooking process. After 5 minutes, drain well - the stems should still be reasonably firm                                       Toast the hazelnuts in a hot, dry pan, then remove and roughly chop. Add to the hazelnut oil                                       Toss the broccoli in olive oil and season with flaky sea salt. Place under a hot grill and turn after 1-2 minutes                                       Don’t worry if some of the leaves start to burn just a little - the bitter notes taste good. Once hot and slightly charred, dress with the hazelnuts                                       For the parsley sauce, peel and slice the banana shallots and garlic, sweat down in the butter in a medium sized pan. Add the reserved ham stock and bring to the boil                                       Chop the flat parsley, including the stalks. Place the ham stock and parsley in a blender, blitz for 3-4 minutes before adding the xanthan gum - this will stop the sauce splitting as it cools. Season with black pepper                                       Serve the glazed ham with the rest of the accompaniments                 ",medium,1

Then, add a good pinch of the herb de Provence and cook for a further 5 minutes                                       Transfer to a 20 x 30cm baking dish, spreading out and pressing the onions to cover the base. Cut the aubergines and tomatoes in half, then slice into semi-circles, approximately 1/2cm in thickness                                       Arrange a row of the sliced tomatoes along the length of the dish on top of the onion, so they are overlapping slightly. Repeat with the aubergines so that all of the onion is covered. Sprinkle over some more herb de Provence, pour in the olive oil and season well                                       Bake in the oven for 3 hours, then remove and allow to cool. Place a tray onto the byaldi and evenly distribute weights on top. Leave to press in the fridge overnight, then remove the weights and turn the byaldi out onto a chopping board. Cut into portions and set aside to reheat later                                       To confit the peppers, peel each pepper with a peeler and cut off the tops and bottoms, so you are left with cylinders. Cut the pepper open, then remove the seeds and any white membrane from the inside surface of the pepper. Cut the flesh into bite-size triangles                                       Add the pepper triangles to a pan, cover with the olive oil and add the thyme and garlic. Cook gently at  80-90˚C for 45 minutes, then drain and allow to cool (you can reserve the oil for use in other dishes)                                       Meanwhile, prepare the lamb. Add the shony, dulse, panko breadcrumbs, salt and pepper to a food processor and blitz to combine. Dip the lamb racks into the egg white, followed by the seaweed and breadcrumb mix, pressing down to form a neat crust. Rest in the fridge for 1 hour to firm up                                       Preheat the oven to 180°C/gas mark 4                                       To finish the dish, place the byaldi portions in the oven to warm through and heat the pepper triangles until just warm. Heat some rapeseed oil in a frying pan until hot (but not smoking), then add the lamb racks and seal on all sides                                       For medium rare, place the lamb in the oven for 4 minutes to heat through, then remove and allow to rest for 10 minutes. Cook for longer if preferred                                       Divide the byaldi onto 4 plates, then add the red and yellow pepper triangles. Slice the rested lamb racks, arrange on top of the byaldi and serve immediately                 ",medium,1
17,,"                     For the marinade, place all the ingredients in a blender and blitz until smooth. Place the lamb rumps in a dish and pour over the marinade, making sure the lamb is well coated. Cover with clingfilm and leave in the fridge for 24 hours                                       The pickled tomatoes can also be made up to a day ahead. Place the white wine vinegar, brown sugar and coarse sea salt in a large pan and simmer until the sugar has dissolved, then set aside                                        In a separate pan, heat the extra virgin olive oil until just starting to smoke, then add the minced ginger, garlic, mustard seeds, Szechuan pepper, cumin and cayenne. Stir over the heat for a few minutes, until the spices are aromatic and fragrant                                       Take off the heat and combine with the vinegar mixture, then pour over the chopped tomatoes, shallots and chilli in a bowl. Mix well, then store in the fridge until needed                                       For the leek purée, add the shallots, garlic and ginger to a pan with the butter and cook over a medium heat until the shallots are very soft. Add the plum wine and continue to cook until the mixture has reduced by half                                       Bring a pan of salted water to the boil, then add the sliced leeks and blanch for 1 minute. Drain, then add to the shallot mixture along with the cream. Bring to the boil then remove from the heat                                       Add the mixture to a blender and blitz to a smooth purée (for a really smooth texture, you could also pass the purée through a fine sieve). Season to taste and keep warm until ready to serve                                       Preheat the oven to 180°C/gas mark 4                                       For the baby gems, heat a frying pan over a high heat with a little oil, then sear the lettuce halves with a little salt and pepper                                       Transfer the seared lettuce to a baking tray and spoon over any cooking liquid from the pan. Add a knob of butter and bake the lettuce in the oven for 5 minutes                                       To cook the lamb, remove the rumps from the marinade and place fat-side down in a hot ovenproof frying pan. Pan-fry over a medium heat for a few minutes to render the fat down, season with a little salt and pepper, then when starting to caramelise, add a knob of butter and flip the rumps over                                       Transfer to the oven and cook for 7–9 minutes. At this point the lamb will be very tender and quite rare, so cover with a tea towel and leave in a warm place to rest for 15 minutes                                       To serve, spread a spoonful of the leek purée across each plate, then top with a baby gem lettuce half, spreading out the leaves. Slice the lamb rumps and place on top with a spoonful or of the pickled tomatoes. Garnish with some fresh watercress and drizzle over lamb juices from the pan                  ",medium,1
18,,"                     72 hours before you want to serve the dish, mix together the thyme, rosemary, garlic and salt and rub the mixture all over the lamb. Leave to salt in the fridge for 24 hours                                       Preheat a water bath to 72°C                                        After 24 hours, wash off the salt then place in a vacuum bag. Seal and cook in the water bath for 24 hours. If you don't have sous vide equipment, place in a tin, cover with foil and slow roast for 5 hours at 120°C                                       Once cooked, strain the cooking liquid from the lamb through a fine sieve into a pan and reduce to a sauce-like consistency. Press the shoulder under a heavy chopping board in the fridge for a further 24 hours                                       You also need to make the potato terrine 24 hours in advance. Peel the potatoes and slice finely using a mandoline                                       Layer into a suitable terrine mould, brushing with the butter and seasoning with salt as you go, you will need 12 layers in total                                       Preheat the oven to 160°C/gas mark 3                                       Cover with foil, bake for 1 hour then remove from the oven and place a piece of parchment on top. Cover with a tray and add a little weight to press the terrine. Leave overnight                                       Turn the terrine out of the tin and slice into portions. At this point, remove the lamb from the fridge and cut into portions the same size as the potato terrine. Return the portions of lamb and terrine to the fridge until ready to serve                                       12–24 hours in advance of serving, make the mint oil. Blanch the leaves in salted boiling water then refresh in iced water                                       Squeeze excess water from the leaves and blitz well with the oil until smooth. At the restaurant, the mint oil is processed in a centrifuge for 30 minutes. To make at home, sit a sieve lined with double-layered muslin cloth over a bowl. Pour the oil into the cloth and leave the bright green oil to drip through overnight in the fridge                                       At least 5 hours before eating, make the ragù (though this can be made a couple of days in advance if preferred). Begin by caramelising the mince in a large pan. Once coloured nicely, add the shallots, garlic and thyme and cook until translucent                                       Add the chopped tomatoes and simmer for 30 minutes                                       Add the stock and cook on a low simmer for around 4 hours until reduced and glossy                                       To make the lemon purée, place the lemons in a pan of cold water and bring to the boil. Once boiling, refresh the lemons in ice water. Repeat the process 6 times (using fresh water each time)                                       Make a 50/50 sugar syrup by dissolving 500g sugar in 500ml water                                       Blend the lemons whole in a high-powered blender, adding the sugar syrup until you achieve your desired consistency and flavour (you might not need it all)                                       To make the broad bean purée, blanch in salted boiling water for a couple of minutes then plunge into ice cold water (reserve some of the cooking water)                                       Transfer half of the beans to a blender and blitz to a smooth purée, adding some of the cooking water to loosen if needed                                       Peel the rest of the broad beans and reserve for plating                                       Blitz the black garlic to a purée and season with soy sauce. Char the loin, preferably over a fire grill, until cooked medium rare, then glaze in the black garlic paste and leave to rest in a warm place for 5 minutes before carving. Push onto bamboo skewers and serve this element of the dish on a mixed herb cress salad                                       Pan-fry the lamb sweetbreads in lots of foaming butter until golden. Season with salt                                       Plate the sweatbreads in a small bowl and top with the warmed ragù, broad beans and broad bean leaves on top                                       Preheat the oven to 180°C/gas mark 4                                       When ready to serve, pan-fry the lamb shoulder portions until they're a nice golden colour. Meanwhile, brown both sides of the terrine in a frying pan then warm through in the oven                                       Gently reheat the lamb sauce in a small pan                                       Scatter a few liliput capers on a plate and add some broad bean purée and lemon purée in the centre of the plate.

Slow cook in the oven for 2 hours 45 minutes                                       Remove from the oven and leave to cool thoroughly in the oil in the fridge                                       Once the lamb is cold, remove from the oil. Separate the individual rib bones and leave in the fridge until required                                       Preheat the oven to 220°C/gas mark 7. To prepare the salt crust, place the salt and flour in a mixing bowl and pour in some water, mixing at the same time, until the water, salt and flour form a dough                                       Roll the dough out to a 1cm thickness and wrap each celeriac in the pastry, making sure to seal completely. Bake on a roasting tray in the oven for 30 minutes                                       After 30 minutes, turn the oven down to 180°C/gas mark 4 and bake for a further 30 minutes. Once cooked, remove from the oven and leave to cool at room temperature                                       Turn the oven up to 200°C/gas mark 5 and roast the tomatoes for the jam for half an hour. Remove and allow to cool                                       Blend the finely chopped onion, garlic and ginger with all the spices and a little olive oil in a blender, then lightly fry for 2 minutes in a pan                                       Add the roasted tomatoes, caster sugar, nam pla and vinegar and cook slowly over a low heat for approximately 30 minutes until it thickens                                       While the jam is reducing and thickening, remove the broad beans from their pods, then blanch for 1 minute in boiling water. Refresh in iced water and pop out of their skins                                       Place the charcoal at the bottom of a very deep, old saucepan and place a cooling rack over the top so that it's secure                                       Using 2 tbsp of the olive oil, lightly oil and then season the lamb loin with a pinch of salt and pepper                                       Turn the heat under the saucepan up to medium. Once the charcoal starts to turn white, place the lamb loin on the cooling rack with a sheet of aluminium foil over the top. Keep on the heat for 5 minutes. Turn and cook for a further 3 minutes, then remove from the heat                                       Cut the lamb loin into 1cm-thick slices (this can be done either before or after smoking the lamb)                                       Crack open the pastries encrusting the celeriacs and discard the pastry and excess salt.

20,,"                     Begin by preparing the marinade for the black cod - you will need to do this the day before. Add the liquorice liqueur, honey, Prosecco, lemon peel, chocolate mint leaves, chilli and tarragon to a suitably-sized container and mix to combine. Use to coat the cod fillets evenly and marinate in the fridge overnight                                       The next day, remove the cod from the marinade and season the fish with salt and pepper. Set aside until ready to cook                                       For the jam, place the chopped onions, caster sugar, beetroot and vinegar in a pan and simmer for approximately 45 minutes. Once the mixture resembles a thin jam, use a spatula to press it through a durable, strong sieve to remove lumps. Allow to cool                                       Once ready to cook the fish, preheat the grill to a low-medium heat and slowly cook the cod for 15-20 minutes until nicely glazed and firm                                       To prepare the broad bean and pea garnish, start by removing the outer layer of skin from the griotte onions, leaving on the roots to maintain shape. Peel the pearl onions and slice in half lengthways                                       Add a good dash of the olive oil to a pan (with matching lid) over a medium-high heat. Place the pearl onions in the pan, cut-side down, and colour until golden brown. Add the griotte onions, along with the salt and white pepper. Once both types of onion are tender, add the peas and broad beans and stir through                                       Lower the heat and cover (if you don't have a lid, use foil to cover) and cook for a further 5 minutes. Remove the lid and add the nutmeg and chopped mint before serving                                       Spoon some of the smooth onion jam onto each plate, followed by the cod, the broad bean and onion mixture and finally some fresh pea shoots.

21,,"                     Begin by making the tomato sauce. Put the onion into a saucepan with half the oil and let it sweat slowly over a low-medium heat for around 15 minutes until it's soft (do not allow it to colour). If it looks as though it might catch, add a splash of water to the pan                                        Add the tomatoes and season with salt. Leave to simmer over a low heat for about 45 minutes, until the tomatoes are thick and rich, adding a little water if the level of the liquid gets too low. Remove from the heat                                        Put the remaining oil in another pan with the garlic and cook over a low-medium heat. When it's almost golden brown, add the basil leaves and stir. Pass the oil through a sieve into the cooked tomato sauce                                        Whisk the sauce to break up the tomatoes. If it's too thick, thin it with a little water, ideally some pasta cooking water. Pass the sauce through a wide-holed sieve resting over a bowl, and use the back of a ladle to extract the smooth mixture. Check the seasoning and add more salt if necessary                                        Preheat the oven to 200°C/gas mark 6                                        Blanch the peas in boiling water for 30 seconds, then drain well                                        Put 8 of the squid and the egg whites into a food processor and pulse until they are roughly chopped. Add the peppers, blanched peas and chives and continue to pulse until you have a coarse mixture                                        Use this mixture to stuff the remaining calamari, keeping some space free at the top. Place a piece of the tentacles at the end of the filling and close the calamari with a rosemary sprig or a toothpick                                        Trim the other end of each calamari to create a tiny hole and keep the filling from bursting out when cooking                                        Heat a large heatproof baking dish over a medium heat and fry the garlic in 1 tablespoon of olive oil.

27,,"                 Start by making the filling. Get your biggest frying pan over a high heat and add 1 tbsp of olive oil. Add a third of the mushrooms or enough to cover the base of the pan, season with salt and pepper, and sauté until nicely brown and beginning to crisp at the edges (around 10 minutes.) Transfer to a bowl and keep frying the rest in batches until all the mushrooms are golden, adding 1 tbsp of olive oil after each batch                                  When all the mushrooms are in the bowl, put the pan back on the heat and add the remaining olive oil. Add the garlic, thyme and leeks, season with a good pinch of salt and pepper and cook on a medium heat for 15 minutes, until buttery and soft. Meanwhile, preheat an oven to 200°C/ fan 180°C/gas mark 5                               Next, add the cooked mushrooms back in the pan with the wine or stock and simmer until almost all the liquid has evaporated, another 5–7 minutes. Now add the mustards, parsley and crème fraîche, then take off the heat and allow to cool. Taste and add more salt and pepper if needed                               While the filling cools, make the pastry. Place the flour, cheddar, poppy seeds and butter in a food processor with a pinch of salt. Process until the mixture resembles fine breadcrumbs. Add 60–80ml of chilled water and process until the mixture comes together to form a smooth ball. Wrap in cling film and chill for 30 minutes                               Once rested, roll out the pastry on a lightly floured board into a 30cm disc and place on a lined baking tray                                  Mix all but a tablespoon of the eggs to the cooled leek and mushroom mix and then place into the centre of the pastry. Fold over the 5cm border and roughly pleat. Brush the pastry edge with the beaten egg and sprinkle liberally with Parmesan. Bake for 30-35 minutes, or until golden and cooked through                               While the pie cooks, heat some olive oil in a frying pan and add the sage leaves, frying until crisp.

28,,"                     Start by making the pea mousse, as this will need to be made a day in advance. Add the peas, milk, olive oil, salt and sugar to a blender and blitz until smooth. Pass through a fine sieve                                       Place the gelatine in a bowl of cold water for 5 minutes, or until softened. Add a ladleful of the sieved purée to a small pan and gently warm through, then dissolve the softened gelatine into it. Add the mixture to the rest of the purée, stirring to combine                                       Divide the mixture between eight serving bowls, aiming for roughly 100g of mousse per bowl. Cover each bowl with cling film and lightly press it over the surface of the mousse – this prevents a skin from forming and stops the mousse absorbing any aromas. Leave to set overnight in the fridge                                       For the mint snow, divide the mint between two mixing bowls. Bruise the mint in one of the bowls using the back of a rolling pin, or another heavy object                                       Add the water, sugar and salt to a pan and bring to the boil, then pour over the bruised mint. Cover the bowl with cling film and allow the mint to infuse for 10 minutes                                       Pass the liquid through a sieve, making sure to squeeze out all of the liquid from the leaves. Bruise the mint in the second bowl, then bring the infused liquid to the boil and pour over the second bowl of mint, again allowing it to steep for 10 minutes before straining through a fine sieve. Pour the liquid into a container, allow to cool then freeze overnight                                       On the day you plan to serve the dish, use a fork to scrape the frozen mint-infused liquid into large flakes, making sure you scrape right down to the bottom so no large chunks of ice remain. Reserve in the freezer until needed                                       For the mint oil, bring the water to a rapid boil and add the salt. Using a large slotted spoon to assist you, blanch the mint and baby spinach in small batches, cooking each batch for 30 seconds. As soon as each batch is done, plunge into a bath of ice water to refresh                                       Drain the blanched spinach and herbs well and place in the centre of a clean tea towel or muslin cloth. Twist the cloth to squeeze all the liquid out of the leaves until they feel dry                                       Blend the herbs with the oil in a high-powered blender with a pinch of salt on the highest speed possible, until the oil turns bright green and the outside of the blender feels hot to the touch. Drain the oil through a sieve lined with two layers of muslin cloth, set over a bowl to catch the liquid                                       To prepare the fresh peas, blanch the mangetout in rapidly boiling salted water for 20 seconds until softened, then refresh in ice water. Leave them to drain on kitchen paper                                       Divide the fresh podded peas into smaller and larger peas. Keep the small peas aside to be served raw                                       Blanch the larger peas in rapidly boiling salted water for 1–2 minutes until tender, then refresh in iced water. Leave them to drain on kitchen paper                                       Carefully split open one side of the mangetout and remove the string of small undeveloped peas from the inside. Fill with 4 or 5 of the larger blanched peas to resemble a full pod                                       To make the lemon dressing, mix together the lemon juice, vinegar, water sugar and salt, then use a hand blender to emulsify with the olive oil. Set aside                                       To serve, remove the pea mousses from the fridge. Mix the reserved small raw peas with a spoonful of the lemon dressing and scatter a tablespoon of them over the top of each mousse                                       Place two of the stuffed mangetout pods on top, pointing at 7 and 5 o’clock. Drizzle a few drops of the Chardonnay vinegar over each dish. Place one mint tip on its side immediately to the left of the mangetout, then insert another five tips around it                                       Lightly dress the pea shoots in the lemon dressing, then place 6 above the stuffed mangetout and top with a pea or viola flower.

29,,"                     Begin by preparing the pickled green grapes - these will be placed in the dehydrator and made into raisins later. Place the water, lemon juice, olive oil, Pernod, sugar, star anise, thyme and tarragon in a pan and bring to a simmer, melting the sugar and combining all of the ingredients. Add the picked white grapes, bring back to a simmer for 10 minutes, then remove from the heat and leave to cool                                       Once cooled, leave to infuse for 1 hour. Then, drain the grapes (reserving the liquid for serving) and place in the dehydrator overnight. Remove the grapes once they are semi-dried and resemble raisins. Set aside until required                                       For the mint oil, blanch the mint leaves in salted boiling water for 1 minute. Refresh in iced water, squeeze as much liquid out of the mint as possible, then place into the dehydrator                                       Once completely dry, add to a Thermomix and cover with the grapeseed oil. Bring up to 85°C, transfer to a muslin bag and hang over a jug to collect the liquid that drips through. Set aside until required                                       To start preparing the cauliflowers, remove the green leaves from the head of each cauliflower. Cut the leaves from the stalk and discard                                       Use a small paring knife to remove the florets from the cauliflowers. Select 12 of the largest pieces for the fondants and cut these in half through the stalk, allowing 6 halves for each portion                                       Cut the remaining pieces into small florets. Blanch the small florets and stalks in salted boiling water for 1 minute, then refresh in iced water and set aside                                       Reserve all of the trimmings from the cauliflowers and blitz into small pieces using a Robot Coupe – this will be used for the purée at a later stage                                       To prepare the cauliflower slices, cut the cauliflower in half through the middle of the stalk and slice very finely on a meat slicer to achieve thin cross-sections of cauliflower. Reserve the trimmings for the purée                                       Deep-fry the slices at 160°C/320°F until golden brown, season with fine salt and dry on kitchen paper                                       For the yeasted cauliflower purée, place a heavy-based pan over a high heat and pan-roast the reserved cauliflower trimmings in the vegetable oil until they start to colour.

Cover and place in the oven for 30 minutes                                       After 30 minutes, turn the temperature down to 150°C/gas mark 2 and cook for another 4½ hours                                        While the brisket cooks, place the potatoes into the oven and bake for 1 hour or until fully cooked. Add the double cream and unsalted butter to a saucepan and gently heat until melted, then gradually incorporate the flesh of the potatoes using a potato ricer. Once all the potato flesh has been added to the cream mixture, you should be left with a very silky mash. Season to taste, then set aside to be reheated before serving                                       Place a griddle or frying pan over a high heat and set up a large steamer. Add a dash of rapeseed oil to the pan and place the quartered hispi cabbage, cut-side down, in the pan until it is charred. Flip and char the other cut side of the cabbage, then place the quarters into the steamer for 11 minutes or until tender. Set aside to reheat before serving                                       Once the beef is cooked and very tender, carefully remove it from the sauce and set aside to rest. Pass the cooking liquid through a sieve into a clean pan and place over a medium-high heat to reduce to a gravy consistency                                       Place a frying pan over a high heat and add the scooped out bone marrow. Fry for a few minutes until cooked through and soft whilst you gently reheat the mash. Once the bone marrow is cooked, stir it into the mash and keep warm                                       Reheat the hispi cabbage quarters in the steamer or in a pan over a low heat                                       To plate, place a generous amount of the bone marrow mash on each dish. Carve the brisket into slices and place on top, then a cabbage quarter alongside. Pour over some of the reduced gravy and serve immediately                 ",easy,0
32,,"                     Trim the cheek of any excess fat and connective tissue, and place it in a bowl with the wine, vegetables, bay leaf and thyme. Cover and leave in the fridge to marinate overnight                                        The following day, lift out the cheek and vegetables and pat them dry. Pour the liquor into a saucepan and bring to the boil, skimming off any impurities. Pass through a fine sieve                                        Season and the cheek all over, the sear in a hot frying pan with a dash of oil until coloured all over. Transfer into a large saucepan. Fry the vegetables in the same frying pan, then add to the saucepan along with the cheek. Pour in the strained marinade, bring to the boil, then add the veal stock. Bring to the boil again, then reduce the heat to a very gentle simmer and leave it to cook, covered, for up to 5 hours. Make sure the pan doesn't get too dry – add a drop of water if necessary                                       Once cooked the cheek should be soft to the touch but not falling apart. Remove the cheek (reserving the liquid for later), place it between sheets of cling film onto a clean tray and press down with a weight. Refrigerate overnight                                         The next day, trim the cheek and cut into 4 even strips. Coat each strip in seasoned flour, then in egg, and finally in breadcrumbs. Set aside until ready to cook later                                       Pass the reserved liquid, discarding the vegetables, and reduce over a high heat to 200ml – this will be the base for the sauce diable                                       To make the nettle purée, boil the onion and potato in lightly salted water until soft. Blanch the nettles in the same water for 1 minute, then refresh in iced water. Blend the onion and potato in a blender (add a bit of cooking water if necessary), then add the nettles. If the purée is a bit thin, you can use the xanthan gum to thicken it a little. Pass through a fine sieve into a bowl over ice and season. Reserve for later                                        Preheat an oven to 160ºC/gas mark 2. Remove the stalks of the peppers, cut in half and remove the seeds. Place onto a tray, season and moisten with a little olive oil, cover tightly with tin foil to create some steam and place into the oven. After about 45 minutes you should be able to peel the skin away from the peppers. Once skinned, cut them into long strips about half a centimetre wide and reserve for later                                        Use a turning knife to peel and shape the sweet potatoes into ovals, around 6cm in length. Place them in a single layer in a suitable pan, cover with the water and add a pinch of salt and the butter. Bring to a simmer and cook until the water has evaporated – the butter will help to colour the potatoes. Once cooked, remove the potatoes and reserve for later                                        To make the sauce, place the red wine vinegar, white wine, white pepper, shallot and tarragon in a pan and heat until reduced to a thick syrup consistency. When almost dry, add the reserved and reduced 200ml of cooking liquor. Remove the tarragon and reduce to a thin sauce consistency. Pass through a fine sieve, season and reserve for later                                        Bring a small pan of oil up to 170ºC, and carefully deep-fry the breadcrumbed ox cheek strips until golden brown in colour. Drain on a sheet of kitchen paper and keep warm                                       Season the fillet steaks all over. Place a frying pan over a very high heat and, once hot, sear the steaks on both sides. Reduce the heat and cook for another 3 minutes on each side, then remove from the pan and set aside to rest                                        Bring a pan of salted water to the boil. Blanch the asparagus and grelot onions for one minute, then add the cavolo nero and cook for 2 more minutes. Drain and and toss in melted butter                                        Add the sweet potatoes to the frying pan and reheat them gently. Meanwhile, reheat the nettle purée in a separate pan. Reheat the ox cheek in the oven if necessary, and warm the sauce on the hob                                       To serve, divide the cavolo nero between 4 warmed plates. Place the fillet steak on top, then the potato fondant alongside. Put the breaded ox cheek on top of the potato and drape with slices of pepper. Add a spoonful of the nettle puree and use a spoon to swoop it across the plate, then arrange the asparagus and grelot onion on top. Finish with the sauce diable and serve                 ",medium,1

Place a frying pan over a high heat, add a dash of oil to the pan and season the ox cheeks well with salt. Sear on both sides – once golden brown, transfer to a heavy-based ovenproof pan. Sear the vegetables in a dash of oil until golden, then add to the pan with the ox cheek                                       Pour the red wine into a large saucepan and reduce by three-quarters. Pour over the ox cheeks and vegetables and set aside                                       Spread the spelt flour out over a baking tray and bake for approximately 5–10 minutes until golden brown. Sprinkle over the ox cheeks and lower the oven temperature to 120°C/gas mark ½                                       Top up the dish containing the ox cheeks with water or veal stock and bring to the boil. Cover with a tight-fighting lid or foil, place the dish in the oven and cook for 3–4 hours, or until the ox cheeks are starting to fall apart                                         Remove from the oven and allow the cheeks to cool in the liquid. Once cool, place in the fridge overnight                                       On the day you plan to serve the dish, bring a large pan of water to the boil. Add the potatoes and boil in their skins until soft (approximately 20 minutes). Drain the potatoes and leave to cool                                       Once the potatoes are cool enough to handle, peel away and discard the skins. Add the cream, butter, stock and salt to a large pan and bring to a gentle simmer. Place the potatoes in a blender and blend on a medium speed. Slowly stream in the warmed cream mixture until the potatoes have a custardy consistency. Add the xanthan gum and blend well. Season to taste                                       Transfer the potato mixture into an espuma gun and charge 3 times. Place in a pan of warm water to keep warm until ready to serve                                       Preheat the oven to 180°C/gas mark 4                                       Remove the ox cheeks from the jellied sauce, cut into even portions and place in a heavy-bottomed dish. Transfer the remaining sauce to a pan, bring to the boil then pass through a sieve into a clean pan and continue to reduce to a rich, thick, sauce consistency. Pour the sauce over the cheeks and place in the oven for 10–20 minutes to heat through. Season to taste                                       To prepare the shallot rings, preheat a deep-fryer or deep pan of oil to 190°C                                        Season the flour liberally with salt and pepper. Peel the shallot and slice horizontally into thin rounds. Push the centre of each round to separate into rings, toss the rings in the seasoned flour and deep-fry until golden and crispy. Drain on kitchen paper and set aside                                        For the kale, discard any large or tough stalks and roughly chop the leaves. Bring a pan of salted water to the boil and blanch the kale for a minute until soft, then plunge into iced water. When ready to serve, heat a knob of butter in a pan and add the drained kale, cooking until warmed through. Season to taste                                       To serve, add a portion of the ox cheek to each bowl. Pipe some of the potato foam to one side and place the kale on the other.

Cover 2 of the beetroots in the dough and bake in the oven for 1 - 1 1/2 hours depending on the size - reserve the remaining beetroot                                       Meanwhile, rinse the bone marrow in fresh running water until the blood colour is gone. Place in a smoker and hot smoke for 5-7 minutes, reserve the leftover fat and set both the bone marrow and fat aside                                       For the sauce, place a large pan over a high heat. Pour in the chicken stock and reduce to 50ml. Add in the apple juice and reduce again by half                                       Add the beetroot juice to the pan and season with salt, pepper and vinegar to taste. Place the smoked bone marrow and fat into the pan and cook until the marrow is soft - make sure the sauce does not come to the boil                                       Season the fillet and then sear in the pan for 3-4 minutes, or until browned on the outside. Transfer to the oven and cook for 10 minutes for a rare finish, 12 minutes for a medium rare finish. Set aside to rest                                       In a safe place, burn the hay until it is black. Place the burnt hay into a blender and blend into a fine powder. Roll the cooked fillet in the hay and then slice into 4 portions                                       Once the beetroots are cooked, remove the dough from the beetroots and peel and slice as desired.

35,,"                     For the tomato sauce, place a large saucepan over a medium heat and add the olive oil. Once hot, add the carrot, celery and onion and leave to sweat until soft but not coloured. Add the garlic and cook out for an additional 2-3 minutes until the smell of raw garlic has disappeared                                       Peel the tomatoes, then roughly chop and add to the pan with the basil. Cook the sauce for about 1 1/2 hours on a gentle simmer, stirring from time to time to ensure the sauce is not catching on the base of the pan. Pass the sauce through a mouli and set aside to cool                                       Preheat the oven to 170°C/gas mark 3                                       For the tomato fondue, cook the whole shallots in their skins in the oven until soft. While cooking, peel the tomatoes, cut in half and remove the juice and seeds                                       When ready, remove the shallots from their skins before mixing in a pan with the peeled tomatoes. Decrease the heat of the oven to 150°C/gas mark 2                                       Cover the pan with tin foil and cook for approximately 30–40 minutes. Once the tomatoes are nice and dry, blend them with the butter until you get a nice velvety emulsion. Season with salt and pepper and set aside                                        Now make the plain egg pasta dough. On a work surface or in a mixer with a paddle attachment, combine the 00 flour and durum wheat flour, before adding in the eggs. Mix gently to form a dough, adding a little water if needed                                       Knead the dough by hand on the work surface until smooth. Wrap in cling film and leave to rest in the fridge for at least 1 hour                                       For the nettle pasta dough, wash the nettles and cook in salted boiling water for approximately 20 seconds before cooling in an ice bath. Drain the nettles and squeeze out any excess water                                       Blend the nettles until smooth - you may need to add 1 or 2 of the eggs to help smooth it out. Mix with the 00 flour, durum wheat flour and add the eggs or remaining eggs, as you did with the plain dough                                       Place the dough on the table and knead until the dough is smooth. Wrap in cling film and leave to rest in the fridge for at least 1 hour                                       With a pasta machine, roll out both the plain and nettle pasta doughs until 1mm thick and cut into long sheets. Cook in salted boiling water for approximately 40 seconds                                       Remove using a large slotted spoon, cool the sheets in iced water, then strain and dry on clean kitchen towel. Store in the fridge between layers of cling film until required                                       For the béchamel sauce, bring the milk to the boil with a pinch of nutmeg and salt. Meanwhile, prepare a roux by melting the butter in a pan over a medium heat. Once melted, add the flour and stir for 2 minutes. Once the milk is ready, add it slowly to the roux, stirring continuously with a whisk                                       Allow the béchamel to boil for approximately 5 minutes, then remove from the heat and leave in a hot bain marie until ready to use                                       To make the meat strips, soak the bread in the milk for 1 minute then squeeze the bread to remove any excess milk. Mix with the parsley and garlic before combining with the beef and veal mince                                       Add the Grana Padano, egg, sweet paprika and season with salt and pepper. Roll out the mixture into long sausage-like strips (about 1.5cm thick) and store in the fridge until required                                       Preheat a steam oven to 120°C                                       For the spinach and ricotta strips, wash the spinach and boil in salted water for approximately 20 seconds before cooling in an ice bath. Drain the spinach and squeeze out any excess water                                        Blend the spinach with the ricotta, egg yolk and Grana Padano until just combined, so the spinach still has some texture and is not a complete paste                                       Line a baking tray with greaseproof paper, then spread the mix evenly out on the tray. Cook in the steam oven for approximately 10 minutes, then remove and leave to cool down before cutting into long, 1.5cm thick strips                                       To prepare the quail eggs, lower the eggs into salted boiling water for 4 minutes so they are hard-boiled. Strain and cool in iced water, then peel and cut in half lengthways                                       Cut the aubergine into 1.5cm thick slices, then cut across the slices to make 1.5cm thick strips. Dust the strips in 00 flour. Heat a generous amount of olive oil in a pan and shallow fry the strips all over until cooked and golden brown. Remove and set aside on absorbent kitchen towel                                       For the Grana Padano fondue, combine the Grana Padano and cream in the Thermomix and blend until very smooth – this will take approximately 10 minutes                                       To cook the peas, place the peas in a saucepan and cover with cold salted water. Bring to the boil, remove from the heat and allow to cool. Set aside until required                                       Finally, to make the pesto cream, cut the celeriac into 2cm cubes and cook in simmering salted water until tender. Strain and cool in the fridge. Place all of the ingredients, including the cold, cooked celeriac into the blender and blitz for 1–2 minutes. Cover and store in the fridge until required – pesto is best served fresh but can be stored in the fridge for up to 36 hours                                       Preheat the oven to 150°C/gas mark 2                                       To assemble the lasagne, generously grease a deep baking tray with butter to stop the pasta from sticking. Layer the white pasta sheets across the bottom of the tray, then spread over a thin layer of the tomato sauce, followed by the béchamel to cover                                       Starting at the longest edge of the baking tray, add strips of the mince mixture, spinach mix, quail eggs and fried aubergine, until you cover the bechamel. Add a good sprinkling of grated Grana Padano on the top, followed by some peas and torn pieces of mozzarella. For the second layer, use the nettle pasta as a base and repeat the process                                       Repeat both of the steps again until all the ingredients have been used, to form 4 layers of pasta and 3 layers of fillings. Spread on top more of the tomato sauce, béchamel sauce and Grana Padano to finish                                       Place in the oven for approximately 20 minutes, then remove and leave to cool in the blast chiller.

Cook for around 3 minutes, until softened and translucent, then add in the diced potato and cook for another 2 minutes. Chop the sage and add this to the pan with the bay leaf, then season with a little salt and pepper                                       Strain the rehydrated morels (reserving the liquid) and add them to the pot along with the barley, mushroom soaking liquor and enough chicken stock to cover everything. Leave to simmer, covered, for around 25 minutes until the barley is tender – you can top the pot up with water as you go but the end result shouldn’t be soupy. Once you’re happy with the texture, leave to rest for a few minutes before serving (or keep warm over a very low heat if needed)                                       While the barley stew cooks, prepare the chicken.

Allow the residual heat to cook and crisp up the chicken skin for a few minutes, then dot the halved shallots around the chicken pieces                                       Transfer the chicken to the oven for 25 minutes, or until the chicken is just cooked through. Remove the chicken from the pan and set aside to rest, then pour the wine into the pan and gently heat to create a simple pan sauce                                       To serve, get a large serving plate and spoon on the barley. Cut the chicken into smaller pieces, if preferred, then place then alongside. Add a bunch of watercress, sprinkle with parsley, drizzle with olive oil and season. To finish, squeeze the roast shallots out of their skins and dot around the chicken                 ",easy,0
38,,"                     Begin this whole chicken recipe by making the stock. Place the ingredients for the poaching stock into a large saucepan and fill with warm water                                        Bring to a gentle simmer, then add the chicken, topping up with more water if necessary. Cover with a lid and simmer very gently for 40 minutes                                        Remove the chicken from the stock and allow to dry off slightly. Strain the stock into a clean saucepan, bring to the boil and continue to boil gently until it has reduced to a third                                        Remove the pan from the heat and whisk in the mustard and cream. When ready to serve, reheat gently and whisk in the chopped tarragon                                        Make the crust by putting all the ingredients into a food processor and whizzing until it clumps together                                        Preheat the oven to 150°C/130°C fan/Gas 2. Smother the crust mixture on to the chicken, then place it in the oven for 45 minutes                                       For the cauliflower, put a chargrill pan over a very high heat whilst blanching the cauliflower for 3 minutes in seasoned boiling water, then drain                                       Toss the florets in the vegetable oil, then chargrill until they are starting to brown. Sprinkle with the curry powder as they are being grilled. Sprinkle with the macadamias and parsley when ready to serve, plating up next to the encrusted chicken                 ",medium,1
39,,"                 To make the dough, dissolve the yeast in the water in a large bowl. Add the flours and mix with your fingertips until a rough dough forms. Cover the bowl with cling film and leave to rest at room temperature for 30 minutes                               Sprinkle the salt over the dough, then add the sour cream. Knead the ingredients are evenly-combined and the dough pulls away from the sides of bowl and holds together in a loose, wet ball (this should take about 5 minutes and the dough will be very soft and wet – you can lightly moisten your hands to prevent sticking if needed)                               Cover the bowl with cling film and leave to rise at room temperature for another 30 minutes                               Knead the dough for an additional couple of  minutes. Cover and refrigerate                               When you’re ready to cook the flatbread, take the dough out of the fridge and leave to stand at room temperature until it doubles in size                               Shape into a ball, divide into 4 and roll out into flatbread shapes. Cook in a hot frying pan until the flatbreads are crispy and cooked through. Brush with butter and sprinkle with some sea salt                               To make the pea and broad bean purée, place all of the ingredients in the Vitamix container in the order shown in the ingredients list                               Blend on Variable 10 until all ingredients are incorporated into a smooth paste, for about 1–2 minutes. You may need to add a splash of water as the mixture is blending in order to create the purée, and use the tamper if needed. Set aside in the refrigerator                                Season the chicken with the salt, pepper and garlic and place skin-side down in a cold frying pan. Turn the hob on at a medium heat and cook slowly, until the fat in the skin has rendered out and the skin begins to crisp up                               After 7–10 minutes, or when the skin is flat, crispy and golden brown, flip the chicken and cook through for another 5 minutes or so                               Peel the crispy skin off the chicken and set aside on kitchen roll. Slice the chicken into 4cm pieces and add the butter and another sprinkle of salt. Set aside                               Toast the sanshō pepper in a dry frying pan until aromatic. Place in a pestle and mortar and grind to a powder                               Add the crème fraîche, buttermilk and sanshō powder to the Vitamix container and blend on Variable 5 for 30 seconds                               To assemble to dish, using the back of a tablespoon, smear the pea and broadbean mixture around the flatbreads like you would tomato sauce on a pizza                               Lay the chicken pieces on top of the flatbreads and follow with broken shards of the chicken skin                               Drizzle over the sanshō pepper crema and loosely scatter over the leaves to finish the dish             ",medium,1
40,,"                     The majority of the elements of this dish can be made in advance a few days beforehand, so if you're planning to tackle this recipe be sure to read it through several times and come up with a plan of action. Before serving you will need to reheat a few elements and finish off the rice and the chicken feet, but everything else can be prepared before serving. To make it easier to follow, we have broken up the recipe into smaller micro-recipes to cover each element. Good luck!                                       To make the crispy chicken feet: add the water and chicken feet to a pressure cooker, then cover and cook for 1 hour. Remove the lid and leave until cool enough to handle. Remove the talons with a sharp knife, then score down the length of each of the toes on the top side of the foot. Use tweezers to remove all the bones, leaving the sinew and cartilage attached to the skin of the foot, then dehydrate at 60°C (either in a dehydrator or a very low oven with the door open) for 3-4 hours. Cover and chill                                       To make the compressed apple: core the apple and cut it into 8mm-thick slices (you should get approximately 10 slices in total). Place in a vacuum bag, ensuring each slice is laying flat. Seal and compress, then open the bag and repeat the process several times until the cells in the apple break down. Add the apple juice into the bag with the apples, then seal and compress a final time. Leave in the fridge to infuse for 12 hours. When ready to serve, cut the apple slices into 8mm dice                                       To make the pickled kohlrabi: combine the water and vinegar in a pan and heat to 90°C. Add the sugar and salt, stirring to dissolve, then place in the fridge to chill. Meanwhile, top and tail the kohlrabi, then cut into 8mm slices. Square the ends off to remove any remaining skin, then cut into 8mm dice – you will need 50 pieces of diced kohlrabi for this recipe. Add the diced kohlrabi to a vacuum bag with enough of the pickling liquor to cover, then seal. Store in the fridge for 12 hours to infuse                                       To make the veal sweetbreads: boil the water and salt together until dissolved. Allow to cool to 40°C, then add the rosemary, thyme, bay leaf, garlic and black peppercorns. Chill for 48 hours to infuse                                       Brine the sweetbreads for 1 hour 30 minutes, then rinse and place in a vacuum bag. Seal and cook in a water bath at 65°C for 1.5 hours, then chill in iced water. Remove the sweetbreads from the bags, remove any excess fat and sinew then break them apart into 6g pieces, following the natural seams where possible. Store in the fridge until needed                                       For the almond rice base: place the vegetable stock in a pan and heat to 95°C. Place a separate pan over a medium-high heat and add the olive oil, followed by the rice. Stir and cook for 1 ½ minutes to toast the rice. Add the white wine to the pan and continue to cook, stirring constantly, until all the wine has evaporated. Add the almost boiling vegetable stock and reduce the heat to a gentle simmer. Cook for 5 minutes, stirring regularly to release the rice starch, then transfer the rice to a large tray in a shallow layer. Transfer the tray to the fridge and chill as quickly as possible – you will need 300g of rice base for this recipe                                       To make the almond cream: place the almonds and water into a high-powered blender and blitz on the highest speed for 2 minutes. Pass through a double layer of muslin, squeezing the pulp to extract as much liquid as possible. Place the milk into a saucepan over a medium heat, then gently bring it to 90°C. Constantly stir the milk so it doesn’t catch and burn, cook for a few minutes then quickly cool over an ice bath. Store in the fridge until needed – you will need 100g of almond cream for this recipe                                       To make the almond acid butter: place the vinegar, white wine and onion in a vacuum bag and seal. Leave for 24 hours to infuse, then pass through a fine sieve into a pan, pushing the onion with the back of a ladle to get as much liquid out of it as possible. Place the pan over a medium heat and reduce to around 105g. Set aside in the fridge                                       Place the almonds in a Thermomix and blitz to a fine powder. Add the butter and blitz on speed 8 for 30 seconds, then transfer to a Pacojet container and freeze. Once frozen, blitz the almond mixture in the Pacojet, then freeze again. Repeat this process a total of 4 times, then transfer the almond butter into a metal bowl after the final spin                                       Weigh out 100g of the onion-infused vinegar reduction and whisk it into the almond butter, then add 1 or 2 drops of the almond oil and whisk to fully disperse. Place the butter into the fridge to chill – you will need 250g of almond acid butter for this recipe                                       To make the saffron mayonnaise: place the Golles vinegar and the sugar into a small pan and gently heat until the sugar is dissolved. Stir in the Forvm Chardonnay vinegar until incorporated, then heat the mixture until reduced to 15g. Set aside                                       Combine the chilled water and ground saffron and set aside to infuse for 20 minutes, then pass through a muslin cloth and set aside                                       Add the Dijon mustard, salt, egg yolk, garlic paste and lemon juice to a Thermomix jug with a butterfly attachment. Turn it up to setting 5, then slowly pour in 100g of the sunflower oil. Once incorporated, add the infused saffron water and the reduced vinegar, then the remaining sunflower oil. Once fully emulsified, check for seasoning and refrigerate until needed. You will need 180g of saffron mayonnaise for this recipe – any leftover has a shelf life of 3 days                                       For the chicken glaze, make a roast chicken stock. Preheat an oven to 190°C/gas mark 5. Place the chicken wings in single layers on roasting trays, then roast for 1 hour 20 minutes until golden. Transfer to a large pressure cooker, deglazing the trays with a little water, then add the rest of the water. Bring to the boil, skimming off any impurities, then add the thyme, rosemary and bay. Cook on full pressure for 2 hours, then pass through a fine sieve and muslin cloth into a large container. Transfer to the fridge to chill                                       Once chilled, remove the solid layer of fat on top of the stock and discard. Add to a large pan and bring to the boil over a high heat. Reduce to 600-700ml as quickly as possible, skimming off any scum, then place in the fridge until required                                       To make the chicken glaze, weigh out 100g of the reduced stock and gently heat to 60°C. Once fully melted, add the lemon juice and whisk. Check the seasoning and keep warm – you will need 50g of glaze for this recipe. Weigh out another 150g of stock for the chicken sauce – the rest can be frozen and used in other dishes                                       To make the infused chicken fat: preheat an oven to 160°C/gas mark 2. Lay the chicken skin flat on a roasting tray in a single layer and roast for 20–30 minutes, or until dark golden brown. Remove from the oven and drain off the rendered fat into an ovenproof saucepan, then return the chicken skins to the oven for a further 10–15 minutes until very crisp. Tip the crisp chicken skins into the pan with the fat, then add the garlic and stir. Cover with tin foil, reduce the temperature of the oven to 170°C and cook the fat for 15 minutes                                       Remove the pan from the oven and add the bay leaf. Stir and leave to infuse for 20 minutes, then add the thyme leaves and leave for 20 minutes. Add the rosemary and leave for a further 20 minutes, then finally add the sage and leave for a final 20 minutes. Pass the fat through a fine sieve, using a ladle to squeeze as much liquid out as possible, then pass through muslin and chill. You will need 50g of infused chicken fat for this recipe                                       For the chicken sauce: heat 150g of the reduced chicken stock to 80°C, then add the thyme and infuse for 10 minutes, maintaining the temperature. Add the bay leaf and infuse for a further 5 minutes, then whisk in 50g of the infused chicken fat and lemon juice. Chill until needed – you will need 120g of sauce for this recipe                                       Finish off the chicken feet and almond rice before serving. Heat a deep-fat fryer or deep pan of oil to 190°C, then deep-fry the chicken feet for a few minutes until puffed and golden. Break them into individual toes – you should have 40 in total. Season and keep warm                                        To finish the rice, place a large saucepan over a medium heat and add the chicken bouillon and 300g of the almond rice base. Bring to a simmer, constantly stirring, and allow the stock to reduce. Once the stock has reduced to create a creamy texture, keep tasting the rice until the right texture (tender with a slight bite) is achieved                                       Remove the pan from the heat and stir in 250g of the almond acid butter, then place back over the heat ensuring the mixture doesn’t boil. Add 100g of the almond cream, stirring to emulsify, then taste for seasoning                                       Now that you have all the required elements for this recipe, you should have the following: 180g of saffron mayonnaise; 50 pieces of pickled kohlrabi; 50 pieces of compressed apple; 1kg of almond rice; 50 pieces of veal sweetbread; the crispy chicken feet; 120g of chicken sauce and 50g of chicken glaze. You will need to gently reheat the chicken sauce, chicken glaze and veal sweetbreads before serving                                       To plate, ladle 100g of the almond rice into the base of each bowl. Liberally brush the veal sweetbreads with the chicken glaze and place 5 pieces on top of the rice, then arrange 4 crispy chicken toes alongside. Scatter over the kohlrabi, apple, smoked eel and flaked smoked almonds, then drizzle over around 12g of chicken sauce. Pipe dots of the saffron mayonnaise on top of the rice, then finish with the sorrel leaves and smoked olive oil                 ",challenging,2
41,,"                     Preheat a water bath to 64°C                                       To confit the egg yolks, place the whole eggs into the water bath and cook for 1 hour and 15 minutes. After this time, turn the bath down to 50°C to hold the temperature. Alternatively, poach the eggs to your liking before serving                                       For the soup, heat the vegetable oil in a heavy-based pan over a medium-high heat. Add the chicken legs and cook until dark and golden all over. Add the celery, onion and leek and sweat for approximately 3-5 minutes until soft and translucent                                       Add the thyme, parsley and bay, pour over the chicken stock and cook on a gentle boil until the stock is reduced by half. Meanwhile, melt the butter in a pan and mix in the flour to form a smooth paste                                       Once the stock has reduced, add the butter and flour paste, stir through and gently simmer for 30 minutes. After this time, remove from the heat and pass through a fine chinois                                       While the soup is still warm, add the crème fraîche and sherry and season with lemon juice, salt and pepper to taste. Set aside until ready to serve                                       For the croutons, slice the brioche into 1cm thick slices and cut each slice into 1cm cubes. Place on a tray and toast under the grill until golden brown                                       To serve, heat 4 portions of the soup in a small saucepan, then transfer to serving jugs. Add a splash of olive oil to a small frying pan and sauté the mushrooms until golden brown. Add the butter, then add a splash of water and stir to create an emulsion                                       Remove the eggs from the water bath and very carefully separate the yolks from the whites. Place a yolk into the bottom of each serving bowl, alongside the glazed mushrooms and toasted croutons. Serve immediately with the jugs of hot soup on the side                 ",challenging,2

Season thoroughly all over and place the rump fat side down in the pan. Continue to turn until all sides are sealed and golden brown. Transfer the pan to the oven and cook for 6 minutes                                       Remove from the oven and add the remaining lamb fat, rosemary and garlic. Coat the lamb in the rosemary and garlic mixture. Set aside to rest                                       For the sweetbreads, place a large frying pan on a medium heat. Evenly coat the sweetbreads in seasoned flour. Add the butter to the pan and wait for it to lightly foam. Add the sweetbreads to the pan, ensuring there is enough space in the pan for them to cook                                       Cook the sweetbreads quickly and evenly, otherwise they will not be tender. Once cooked, remove from the pan and place on absorbent towel. Season with salt                                       For the pea purée, put all the ingredients into a blender and set it to a low speed. Increase the speed slowly until the maximum has been reached. Leave to blend for a further minute and pass through a fine chinoise. Finish by seasoning to taste. Place in a small saucepan ready to reheat and serve                                       Return the lamb rump to the oven for a further 3 minutes, adding the sweetbreads for the last minute                                       Thoroughly wash the wild garlic leaves and trim off any fibrous ends. Melt the butter in a saucepan on a medium heat. Once hot add the wild garlic, salt and cook until the wild garlic begins to wilt                                       For the broad beans and peas, bring the butter, salt and water to the boil while whisking to emulsify. Once it begins to boil, add the broad beans and peas for one minute. Remove from the liquid and serve immediately                                       Prepare the plate by adding the wilted garlic, broad beans, peas and dotted pea purée.

43,,"                     Begin by preparing the sauerkraut. Thinly slice the cabbage and the onion and add to a large pan with the bouillon, water, caraway seeds and bacon. Simmer over a low heat for 2 hours and leave to cool, then transfer to a vacuum bag and seal. Keep in the fridge for at least 4 days before using                                       Preheat the oven to 180°C/gas mark 4                                       For the lamb jus chop the lamb bones and roast in the oven until golden brown. Fry the vegetables in a large saucepan with a little oil until caramelised, then add the garlic, rosemary and lamb bones. Cover with the stocks and simmer for one hour on a medium heat                                       Strain the stock through a fine sieve into a clean pan and reduce until it reaches a sauce-like consistency.

Seal and cook for 45 minutes                                       Preheat the oven to 180°C/gas mark 4                                       Bake the potatoes for around 40 minutes until completely soft, then remove from the oven and slice in half. Pass each potato through a fine drum sieve onto the work surface, bringing all the strained potato together into a rectangle                                       Separate one of the eggs and discard the white, adding the yolk to the potato along with the pasta flour. Gently fold the potato over on itself until the flour and egg are fully incorporated, taking care not to over-mix or the gnocchi will become rubbery                                       Roll the gnocchi mix into a sausage shape and cut into small pieces, then roll these pieces into balls and place on a tray                                       Put a large, shallow pan of water on the heat and bring to a simmer. Whisk the water to create a whirlpool and carefully add the gnocchi. Cook for a few minutes until the gnocchi begin to float, then immediately remove from the pan and plunge into iced water to stop the cooking process                                       Drain the gnocchi and dry on a kitchen cloth. Line up three separate dishes of flour, the remaining egg and the panko breadcrumbs, then dredge the gnocchi through each dish in that order                                        Preheat a deep-fryer to 180°C                                       Remove the lamb from the bags, pat dry and sear in a hot pan with a dash of oil until nicely golden brown on the outside. Set aside to rest                                       Fry the gnocchi for 2 minutes, or until golden brown. Leave to drain a little on kitchen paper                                       Meanwhile, gently reheat the lamb sauce and stir through the red pepper and chopped olives.

45,,"                     Score the skin of the pork belly as finely as possible to just cut through the surface into the fat, taking care not to go too deep with the blade. Ask your butcher to do this for you if you are unsure                                       Place the salt, star anise, paprika, fennel seed and bay leaves in a tub big enough to hold the belly comfortably. Add enough water to cover the meat, whisk to dissolve the salt then add the pork belly skin-side down. Place the tub in the fridge to brine for 24-36 hours                                       Alternatively, add the spices and bay leaves to a coffee grinder and blitz until combined. Mix with 3 tablespoons of salt, rub over the belly and leave to marinate for 12 hours                                       Once ready to roast, preheat the oven to 140°C/gas mark 1                                       Take the belly out of the brine or marinade, rinse under cold water and pat dry. Arrange the potatoes in the roasting tin and top with the pork belly with the skin facing up. Add 200ml of water to the bottom of the dish and roast for 1 1/2-2 hours. The timing will depend on how thick the belly is, so test the meat to check if it is cooked - push a fork into the flesh, it should be nice and tender and come away easily                                       Meanwhile, for the relish, chop the apple roughly and blitz with the green pepper, ginger, onion and garlic in batches until you have a rough purée. Add the purée to a heavy-based saucepan with the chillies, vinegar, fish sauce and sugar                                       Place on a high heat and bring to the boil. Once boiling, reduce the heat to a gentle simmer and cook for approximately 40 minutes, stirring regularly so the chutney doesn't catch. Once it has reached a jam-like consistency, remove from the heat and ladle into sterilised jars to cool. Store until required                                       Once the pork is cooked, increase the oven temperature to 200°C/gas mark 6 and cook for an extra 8-10 minutes so the crackling bubbles up nicely                                       If you are having trouble with the crackling, simply add a splash of oil to a hot heavy-based frying pan and add the pork skin-side down, making sure you press down evenly to get the entire surface well-crackled. Once you are happy with the crackling, leave the pork to rest for 15 minutes. Slice and serve with the chutney and your choice of greens                 ",easy,0

Arrange the pork steak across the bacon                                       Roll a golf ball-sized piece of the stuffing mixture between your hands and place on top of the pork                                       Pull the 4 corners of the cling film together so the bacon rashers meet in the middle. Pull the cling film tight. Repeat this process to make another 3 pork parcels                                       Turn over each parcel to hold the bacon underneath, then store in the fridge for half an hour to set                                       Preheat the oven to 170˚C/gas mark 3                                       Remove the parcels from the fridge and carefully remove all the cling film.

Sprinkle with a little sugar, salt, thyme, a thin slice of garlic and a generous brushing of olive oil                                       Place in a dehydrator for 90 minutes to concentrate the flavour, ensuring they are still plump and not overly dry. Once finished, cut into a large dice and set aside                                       Preheat the oven to 120˚C/gas mark ½                                        Prepare the garlic by making a small prick into the skin of each clove (this will stop them bursting during cooking). Place into a small ovenproof pan with the thyme and add enough olive oil to just cover. Cook in the oven for 1 hour then remove and set aside to cool                                       For the white beans, combine the beans with the carrot, onion, celery, garlic and thyme in a saucepan and cover with a generous amount of vegetable stock                                       Bring to the boil and reduce the heat and gently simmer for 15 minutes. Add a pinch of salt and cook until just tender for a further 25-30 minutes - the final result should be a creamy bean that holds its shape                                       Remove the beans from the heat and allow to cool before removing the other vegetables and thyme. Store in the cooking liquor in the fridge until required                                       To prepare the green beans, cook in boiling salted water for 3-4 minutes, then strain and refresh in ice-cold water. Strain again, cut into 1/2cm barrels and set aside until required                                       For the parsley oil, combine the parsley and a good dash of lemon oil in a blender. Starting on a low speed, slowly pour in a thin stream of olive oil until the parsley starts to blend. Increase the speed and add enough oil to form a coarse, oily purée. Do not over-blend or it will taste bitter and bruised                                       Preheat the oven to 80˚C                                       For the cod, place on a roasting tray and coat lightly in either lemon oil or good quality extra virgin olive oil. Place in the oven for 15-20 minutes, until the flesh firms up and just begins to flake when touched                                       Meanwhile, reheat the white beans in a small amount of the cooking liquid. Once hot, remove from the heat and stir in a knob of butter, the confit tomatoes, chorizo, parsley and lemon juice                                       To finish the green beans, in a small pan, sweat the shallot in butter for 2 minutes, then add the green beans and toss to combine. Season to taste and set aside                                       For the spinach, place a large pan over a medium heat and add 20g of butter. Once melted, add the spinach to the pan. Use a fork to pierce and skewer the garlic clove and use this as the utensil to stir the spinach. Cook until just wilted, season with salt and set aside                                       Remove the fish from the oven and brush with the parsley oil. Scatter the white beans across the centre of each plate and top with the fish. Garnish with the green beans and confit garlic, serve immediately                 ",medium,1

Cook in the water bath for 1 hour, then plunge into iced water to refresh. Remove the bacon from the bag and cut into 5mm dice                                       Preheat the oven to 190°C/gas mark 5                                        Bake the potatoes for 1 hour, or until tender and cooked through. Whilst still warm, cut the potatoes in half, scoop out the flesh and pass through a fine drum sieve                                       Weigh out 150g of the dry mashed potato and place in a mixing bowl with the remaining gnocchi ingredients. Mix until fully combined, then transfer to a piping bag. Cut the piping bag 5cm from the tip                                       Preheat a water bath to 80°C                                        Line a work surface with a layer of cling film. Pipe the gnocchi onto the cling film in a long, continuous ‘sausage’, approximately 40cm in length. Roll the cling film around the gnocchi and tie each end. Repeat this process with the remaining gnocchi mix                                        Poach the gnocchi in a water bath for 10 minutes. Refresh in iced water, then remove the cling film and cut into 2.5cm long pieces. Set aside in the refrigerator until required                                        For the horseradish cream sauce, heat the oil in saucepan over a high heat. Add the reserved sea bass bones and roast until all of the moisture has evaporated. Add the vegetables and continue to cook until the vegetables have slightly softened                                        Deglaze the pan with the white wine and reduce by half. Add the cream, bring to the boil and once boiling point is reached, reduce the heat to low and simmer gently for 15 minutes. Add the grated horseradish, then pass the finished sauce through a fine sieve                                       Preheat a water bath to 55°C                                        Place the sea bass fillets in a vacuum bag and seal in a chamber sealer. Cook in the water bath for 15 minutes                                       Cut the lettuces into halves, keeping the core intact. Lightly brush with oil and caramelise in a hot pan for 1—2 minutes on each side. Add the butter, stock, confit baby onions, gnocchi and diced bacon. Simmer gently for about 5 minutes or until the lettuce is tender and all of the ingredients are warm                                        Remove the sea bass fillets from the vacuum bag and sear in a hot pan for 30 seconds on each side. Season with sea salt crystals and keep warm                                       Heat the horseradish sauce to around 70°C and aerate with a hand blender                                        To serve, place 1 piece of lettuce, 5 pieces of gnocchi, 5 onions and a spoonful of the diced bacon onto each plate.

Wrap the pasta dough in cling film to stop it from drying out and rest in the fridge for 30 minutes                                       Once rested, roll out the pasta by hand until it is thin enough to fit into the thickest setting of your pasta machine                                       Pass the dough through the pasta machine, each time reducing the thickness until it has reached the thinnest setting. Use the cutting attachment to make linguine. Dust with a small amount of flour to stop the linguine sticking                                       To make the red wine sauce, place the wine in a pan with the shallot and boil over a medium heat until the liquid is reduced by half                                       Add the chicken stock and reduce the liquid further until the sauce is thick enough to coat the back of a spoon                                       Add the cream and reduce the liquid again by half on a low heat, making sure the sauce does not split                                       Once the sauce is thick and velvety, pass through a sieve and retain in the pan until needed. Season with salt and pepper if required                                       To make the spiced butter sauce, place the chicken stock in a pan and add the tarragon, cardamom, shallot and cream. Simmer until the flavors have combined and the liquid has reduced by half                                       Pass through a sieve and return to the pan. Finish by adding the cold butter, then reduce the heat to allow the butter to melt gently                                       To prepare the green apple, peel the apple and shave into pieces using a potato peeler. Submerge in water and lemon juice until needed                                       To make the tartare of vegetables, finely dice the celery, fennel, shallot and cucumber and combine in a mixing bowl. Zest and juice the lime and stir into the vegetables                                       Add the mini capers and season with salt and pepper to taste. Set aside at room temperature until needed                                       To cook the linguine, place in boiling salted water for 2–3 minutes or until tender but with a bite. Once cooked, roll the pasta in a little truffle oil to stop it sticking together                                       To make the spiced cod, preheat the oven to 180°C/gas mark 4. Season the fish with the spices and then coat in olive oil                                       Bake for 12 minutes. The fish should just be cooked, but still look slightly translucent in the centre                                       Rub the scallops with a little olive oil and sea salt and sear in a hot pan until just cooked                                       To assemble, neatly arrange the tartare of vegetables in the centre of warmed plates. Place the shaved apple on top of the tartare with the fillet of cod resting on top                                       Place the seared scallop to the side with a little roll of linguine (twist the pasta around a fork, then slip the pasta off the fork and on to the plate)                                       Place a spoonful of the warm spiced butter sauce over the cod and then finish by spooning the warm red wine sauce around the edge of the ingredients.

54,,"                 Preheat the oven to 200c. Soak the sundried tomatoes in a small bowl of warm water, just enough to cover. Set aside. Mix the ground linseed with enough cold water to make a smooth paste and set aside                               Pulse the mushrooms in a food processor with the metal blade until chopped fine. Mix in the tablespoon of olive oil, making sure it coats evenly. Spread out on one or two baking trays (they should be in a thin, even layer) and bake for about 30 minutes, stirring occasionally. They are done when most of the moisture has come out and they are relatively evenly browned. Transfer to a large bowl. If the mushroom residue on the baking tray isn’t burnt, deglaze with a splash of water or wine and scrape as much as you can into the mushrooms – this residue has a huge amount of flavour                               Pulse the chickpeas until mostly broken down and add to the bowl. Remove the tomatoes from the water – set this water aside for another use, it makes a delicious vegetable stock. Pulse to chop finely and add with the olives and Quorn mince                               Scrape the linseed mixture into the other ingredients and mix thoroughly with your hand, so the sticky binder is evenly distributed and all the components are well combined. Put mixture back into the food processor – you may need to do this in batches – and pulse until it comes together into a coherent paste. When ready, the mixture will hold its shape when pressed together with your fingers                               Shape the mixture into patties and wrap each one in a little clingfilm. When wrapped they are even easier to make into a perfect round. Refrigerate for at least 30 minutes, so the whole thing has time to properly set before cooking. When ready to cook, these burgers can be cooked in a frying pan – over medium heat with a film of oil until browned – or they can be barbecued                                NOTE: This whole recipe can be doubled, or even tripled, to make a stash of veggie burgers for the freezer. Just transfer to the freezer after they have been individually wrapped and allow to freeze, then seal the burgers in a freezer bag for further protection             ",easy,0

Strain through a fine sieve into a bowl and transfer to the fridge to chill                                       Once chilled, slice the cucumber into 4mm thick rounds and place in a jar or container. Pour over the chilled vinegar solution, cover and return to the fridge for 3 days to pickle – it is important that the solution is cold as this will preserve the green colour of the cucumber                                       Place the chickpeas in a bowl and cover with cold water. Place in the fridge and leave to soak overnight before using                                       Once soaked, drain and rinse the chickpeas. Place in a large pan and cover with cold water.

Place on a tray in the fridge for at least 20 minutes to firm up                                       To make the chips, place the potatoes in a large pan and cover with cold water. Season well with salt – about 15g per 500ml of water – and place over a high heat. When barely at a simmer, remove from the heat and drain the chips through a colander. Allow to steam in the residual heat for 5 minutes then spread the chips out on a tray to cool                                         For the coleslaw, place all the vegetables in a colander over the sink. Sprinkle over a little salt and mix through the vegetables. Repeat this so the salt is evenly distributed then leave for 15 minutes to draw out excess moisture                                       For the lemon mayonnaise, place the lemon juice in a small pan over a medium heat. Allow to gently simmer until reduced by half then set aside to cool to room temperature. Once cooled, place in a bowl with the egg yolks, salt and mustard then start whisking together                                       Slowly trickle in the rapeseed oil while still whisking until the mixture thickens and emulsifies – you may not need all of the oil.

58,,"                     This dish takes a bit of advance preparation. Begin 3 weeks ahead of time by fermenting the beetroot. Juice a third of the beetroot. Place a 1l Kilner jar on a kitchen scale and return the scales to zero. Add the remaining quartered beetroot to the jar and pour in the beetroot juice. Top up with a mixture of whey and water or just water. Calculate 2% of the weight of the contents of the jar and add this amount of salt to the jar. Seal the jar                                       Leave to ferment at a warm room temperature for about 3 weeks; keep away from direct sunlight. Once ready, the beetroot will be slightly softened and sour. The sealed jar can be stored in the fridge for up to 3 months. Once opened, use within 1 month                                       The shallot vinegar needs to be made at least 3 days in advance (but can be made up to 3 months in advance). Put the shallots in a sterilised jar and cover with the red wine vinegar. Seal and leave in the fridge for at least 3 days before using                                       Line a large sieve with muslin and set it over a deep bowl. Put the yoghurt into the sieve, then gather up the edges of the cloth and secure them together. Leave in the fridge overnight to allow the liquid to drain out of the yoghurt (this liquid or whey can be reserved and used in ferments                                       To make the ember oil, pour the oil into a large pot. Wearing heavy barbecue gloves and using appropriate tongs, gently place the burning hot ember into the oil. Cover with a lid and leave to infuse as it cools. Once cool, strain through a fine sieve.

Remove from the foil and rub off the skins                                       Take a flat tray with a steam insert (such as a deep roasting tray that will hold a flat steaming rack) and spread the apple wood chips over the bottom of the tray. Warm the tray over a medium heat until the chips start to smoke, then turn the heat down to low                                       Place the beetroot on the steam insert/steaming rack and set this over the smoking chips. Completely cover the top and sides tightly with oven-safe cling film so the smoke is sealed inside with the beetroot. Leave to lightly smoke for 7 minutes. Remove the beetroot from the tray and leave to cool                                       Make a brine by adding 500ml and 35g of salt to a pan and bring to the boil to dissolve the salt. Leave to cool                                       Once cooled, pour the brine into a deep bowl. Gentle add the yolks using your hands or a slotted spoon. Cover the surface of the brine with the vegetable oil so that the yolks are held down in the brine. Allow the yolks to brine for 1 hour at room temperature. To serve, gently remove the yolks with your hands or a slotted spoon                                       Mince the 240g of the fermented beetroot with smoked beetroot with a mincer or chop finely with a knife. Season with the 1 tbsp of the shallot vinegar, the capers, a little ember oil and some salt and pepper                                       Using a small ring mould, make a disc of the beetroot mixture in the centre of each plate. Top with a layer of the hazelnut slices. Gently place a brined egg yolk to the side of each disc. Garnish with cracked black pepper and bittercress or watercress. Place a spoonful of the hung yoghurt to the side of each disc                 ",challenging,2

Boil the Amaretto to remove the alcohol, whisk in the brown butter, reserve                                       For the pasta, place the flour and salt in a food processor, slowly add the eggs and 10ml of the saffron water, finally add the olive oil. When the mixture resembles breadcrumbs tip onto a work surface and knead until you have an elastic dough, about 10 minutes. Clingfilm tightly and leave to rest in the fridge for at least one hour                                       Next make the puree. Brown the butter and strain into a clean pan, add the squash, salt and milk. Cook until the squash is completely soft. Blitz in a blender until smooth and pass through a fine sieve                                       Once the pasta has rested, bring to room temperature and roll on a pasta machine through each of the settings until you get to the lowest one. Cut the pasta into 10cm squares.                                         To make the ravioli place 15g of puree in the centre of a square, place another square on top and carefully seal the edges ensuring there are no air bubbles as this will cause the ravioli to burst. Cut each one out with an 8cm pastry cutter                                       Blanch the raviolis in boiling water for 2 minutes and refresh in ice water. Reheat for a further two minutes in gently simmering water just before serving                                        For the broth, in a heavy based pan sweat the squash trim in the butter until the edges start to break down. Season with salt and cayenne. Add the water and bring to the boil. Simmer for 20 minutes. Add the seeds, squash peel and butter. Bring back to the boil and simmer for a further 10 minutes. Strain through a fine sieve and blitz to emulsify the mixture. Chill until needed                                       For the Thai shallots, blanch the shallots in boiling water for 2 minutes, drain. Combine the rest of the ingredients in a separate pan and bring to the boil. Put the blanched shallots into the second pan and simmer for 2 minutes until tender, but retaining a little crunch. Chill in the cooking liquor in the fridge. Trim the bases to enable them to stand on the plate. Reduce the cooking liquid to a glaze consistency and glaze the shallots                                       For the dice, heat the oven to 180°C/gas mark 4. In a flat heavy based oven proof frying pan, heat the butter allowing it to lightly foam. Add the dice and colour all sides until golden. Season with salt, pepper and herbs. Cook in the oven for approximately 5 minutes, until tender. Deglaze with the sherry vinegar and remove from the pan                                       To make the nibbed almonds, heat the oven to 165°C/Gas mark 3 And mix all ingredients together. Place on greaseproof paper on a heavy based tray. Roast for 8 minutes. Allow to cool                                        To make the whipped Gorgonzola crème fraiche, place the crème fraiche, Gorgonzola, salt and cayenne pepper in a mixing bowl. Whip with a mixer until stiff peaks are formed. Keep chilled and cover with cling film until required                                       Cook the spinach in boiling water for one minute, drain and pat dry                                       To plate, divide the spinach between the 6 plates placing in the centre. Place 3 butternut pieces and 3 Thai shallot around the spinach and place 1 ravioli on top. Warm the amaretto glaze and spoon on top of the ravioli. Finish with one Gorgonzola quenelle, a few wood sorrel leaves and a sprinkle of almonds. The butternut broth should be served on the side                 ",medium,1
