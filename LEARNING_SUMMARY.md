# Learning Summary

Through this project I learned:
* conventions for cleaning text data for analysis
* scraping websites for useful information
* how to filter data - e.g. I only extracted the method rather than extracting both the method and ingredients list - the ingredients list would have been redundant as ingredients are often mentioned in the method as well
* how to use python notebooks and all the python libraries that exist for NLP and training models
* the fact that too much data in your model could decrease its overall accuracy
* the machine learning tools available in Azure
* how to use Machine Learning Designer
* how to create an inference pipeline 
* how to deploy your model as a web service
