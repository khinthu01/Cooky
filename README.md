# Cooky
Cooky is a tool that allows users to quickly and automatically classify their recipe's difficulties. This is aimed at independent chefs who publish their recipes online and would like to add a difficulty filter to allow their users to access recipes accessible to their skill levels. Cooky is a multi-class text classification model that searches through instructions in a recipe for features specifically relating to difficulty levels ranging from 'Easy' to 'Challenging'.
