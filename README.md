# Cooky
Cooky is a tool that allows users to quickly and automatically classify their recipes' difficulties. This is aimed at independent chefs who publish their recipes online and would like to add a difficulty filter to allow their users to access recipes accessible to their skill levels. Cooky is a multi-class text classification model that searches through instructions in a recipe for features specifically relating to difficulty levels ranging from 'Easy' to 'Challenging'. 

# Why AI?
If you have a team of skilled chefs and editors the way that food magazines do then determining the difficulty of a recipe may be easy as the difficulty level can be crowdsourced within the team. However, if you're an independent online chef and editor then picking the difficulty of a recipe can feel random and you cannot really be sure if your readers, who may be amateurs, will really agree.
